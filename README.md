This repository creates and distributes the unofficial Appimage of OBS Studio built on top of JuNest, the lightweight Arch Linux based distro that runs, without root privileges, on top of any other Linux distro.

Sinc of October 2, 2025, the two builds are based on the "obs-studio-stable" package in ChaoticAUR and are both available at "[continuous](https://github.com/ivan-hc/OBS-Studio-appimage/releases/tag/continuous)" or "[latest](https://github.com/ivan-hc/OBS-Studio-appimage/releases/latest)" tag:
- **Full** (`full`) build includes libcef and then browser support
- **Lite** (`lite`) build instead has not such library and is about 100 MB smaller (compressed, while extracted is more than 300 MB smaller).

Choose which one is right for you.

Weekly snapshots are also available among the other [releases](https://github.com/ivan-hc/OBS-Studio-appimage/releases).

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
